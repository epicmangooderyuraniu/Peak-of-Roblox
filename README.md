## Roblox Needs Help
As many people have played, **Roblox** has become iconic all throughout our childhoods.  The amount of memories it holds is unmatched by essentially any game as a result of its easy access. However, if you take a look at the state it is in right now you'd be dissappointed to see what it has come to.

Rather than the games or known as now the **Experiences** page being filled with funny obbies on top of actually well developed games, the Experiences page seems to be filled with a ton of games created by these soulless corporations that are trying to farm visits and robux off of kids.

One main things that made the previous roblox game so iconic was their simplicity.  The Games page used to be filled with such a variety of very simple obbies, tycoons, and the occassional actually well-developed game for the time like Phantom Forces.  As kids that were playing on the family computer this was all that we needed to have fun and thats what the platform was desinged to provide.
