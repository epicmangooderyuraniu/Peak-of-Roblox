## Roblox Needs Help
As many people have played, **Roblox** has become iconic all throughout our childhoods.  The amount of memories it holds is unmatched by essentially any game as a result of its easy access. However, if you take a look at the state it is in right now you'd be dissappointed to see what it has come to. 
<br>
Rather than the games, or known as now the **Discover** page, being filled with funny obbies on top of actually well developed games, the Experiences page seems to be filled with a ton of games created by these soulless corporations that are trying to farm visits and robux off of kids.

### So What Made Roblox So Iconic Back Then?
One main things that made the previous roblox game so iconic was their simplicity.  The Games page used to be filled with such a variety of very simple obbies, tycoons, and the occassional actually well-developed game for the time like Phantom Forces.  As kids that were playing on the family computer this was all that we needed to have fun and thats what the platform was desinged to provide.  Off of this plainness that made up the majority of the platform millinos of kids made unforgettable memories with their friends.

### What has Roblox Come to?
However Roblox in its current state has been plagued by a multitude of issues, ones that are simply an oversaturation of a new type of unfun and sloppily created games mixed with issues that literally turned Roblox into a messy court lawsuit.

 ##### The Rise of Simulators:
"Simulators" are a new type of roblox game that has sprouted, grown and spread like a weed throughout these past few years.  Simulators are the epitome of the overstimulation from videogames and media that adults complain about.  To make progress, you get money or some other sort of value gain by clicking your screen, requiring immense amounts of grinding to try and continue to grow exponentially.  Most of these games have things like "pets" that you unironically gamble for, whether its with real money you convert into robux or the in game currency that the children spend hours every day grinding for.  In most of these, there is no well-developed combat system, and it becomes a game of whoever wasted more of their life clicking their screen.

##### The Roblox Lawsuit:
Next, Roblox has had a dilemma throughout recent years that has to do with the content created and uploaded to their site as cosmetics.  They have an extremely big problem of the copying and reuploading of peoples work, to the point that there are thousands of copies of the same exact cosmetic in which it is impossible to find the original.  However Roblox has either completely ignored this problem or has done little to combat it.  The main problem here is that they have had predicaments with real copyright, in which companies and record labels have issues with Roblox because of unpermitted use of logos and songs.  Because of these issues, they have to take down a lot of the content that is uploaded through shirts and pants cosmetics, but fail to compensate/refund those that have already purchased it.  Because of this, a child represented by their father demanded a jury trial for compensation for Roblox's deceptive and unfair conduct.
